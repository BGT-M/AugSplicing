D-Cube (Disk-based Dense-block Detection) is an algorithm for detecting dense blocks in web-scale tensors. 
D-Cube has the following properties:
 - scalable: D-Cube handles large data not fitting in memory or even on a disk.
 - fast: Even when data fit in memory, D-Cube outperforms its competitors in terms of speed.
 - accurate: D-Cube gives high accuracy in real-world data as well as theoretical accuracy guarantees.
